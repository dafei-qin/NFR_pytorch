    """A class that parameterizes faces with the ICT face model.

    This class represents faces parameterized by the ICT face model. Each

    a deformed mesh in terms of the generic neutral mesh, the identity shape
    modes, and the expression shape modes.

        _generic_neutral_mesh: The generic neutral mesh represented as an
            openmesh.PolyMesh object.

        _deformed_mesh: A deep copy of the generic neutral mesh that we will
            deform using the identity and expression shape modes.

        _deformed_vertices: A numpy array of dimension N * 3 where N is the
            number of vertices of the generic neutral mesh. Represents the
            vertices of the deformed mesh.

            the face model expressions.

        _expression_names: A numpy array of strings representing the names of
            the face model identities.

        _num_expression_shapes: The number of face model expressions.

        _num_identity_shapes: The number of face model identities.

        _expression_weights: A numpy array of dimension K representing the
            weights corresponding to each expression shape mode.

        _identity_weights: A numpy array of dimension K representing the
            weights corresponding to each identity shape mode.

            is the number of shape modes and N is the number of vertices.
            Represents the list of expression shape modes computed from the
            expression meshes read in with openmesh.

        _identity_shape_modes: A numpy array of dimension K * N * 3 where K
            is the number of shape modes and N is the number of vertices.
